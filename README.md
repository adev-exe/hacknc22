PlatyPortal acts to give a large portion of people throughout the world access to computer science resources. Through a website and SMS chat bot, PlatyPortal allows people without access to a stable Wi-Fi connection to still be able to learn about coding and browse and apply for jobs. All the functionality and information is available without the need for Wi-Fi.
